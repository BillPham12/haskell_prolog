Prolog program:
To test program you can type:
"isItPossible (X, number of moving steps)"
then type ; to output any possible results.

How to read the list:
This prolog program will return a list of inBoat (X,Y,Z), where
X is number of human,
Y is number of tiger,
Z is number of neanderthal.

Hence, InBoat(0,0,1) means neanderthal go back the east.
InBoat(1,0,0) means neanderthal go back the east.
